# OTanalysis
Python functions and notebooks to analyze optical trap data of actomyosin interactions

This is the code used to analyze optical trap data from the Golman/Ostap labs at UPenn. The functions are implemented in python, with example Jupyter notebooks running through the analysis step-by-step.
This code requires the following packages:
scipy
numpy
pandas
os
glob
matplotlib
nptdms
csv

Functions are not well documented at this time. I am frequently working on updating. You may contact me at bob.c.cail@gmail.com
